I'm looking to start a data analysis project related to Apple in 2021. However, I'm struggling with the data collection process, as it appears to be quite challenging. The data I've attempted to gather seems to consist of random numbers, with 3-4 identical sales figures. Nevertheless, I'm eager to enhance my data analysis skills and would appreciate some guidance on how to proceed.
